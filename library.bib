abstract = {Conversational modeling is an important task in natural language understanding and machine in-telligence. Although previous approaches ex-ist, they are often restricted to specific domains (e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we present a sim-ple approach for this task which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. Our model converses by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation. The strength of our model is that it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this straightforward model can generate simple con-versations given a large conversational training dataset. Our preliminary suggest that, despite op-timizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and gen-eral domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find a solution to a technical problem via conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. As expected, we also find that the lack of consistency is a com-mon failure mode of our model.},
